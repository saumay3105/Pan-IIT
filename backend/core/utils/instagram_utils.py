        Given the trending hashtags: {trends}, create an engaging and attention-grabbing caption for the following content: {content}. 
        Ensure the caption is relevant, popular, and likely to attract a wide audience.
        Deduce the meaning of these hashtags and generate fun and creative captions. Use a few relevant hashtags from the list to boost the post's reach.
        Use English language only.
        For example, if there is a trending hashtag about football and the content is about career growth, you could create a caption like, "#Barcelona didnâ€™t settle, neither should you. Play every move in your #career like it's a Champions League final!"
        Avoid using irrelevant hashtags; only use those that align with the trending topics.
        Return a single caption with relevant hashtags and nothing else.
        Avoid political content.
